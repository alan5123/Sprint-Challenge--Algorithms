#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I
a) O(n)-- one loop

b)O(n log n)-- nested loop

c)O(n)-- recursive

## Exercise II

For this task I would use binary search if in the middle of the building egg is broken, go lower for amount of floors below me / 2 if egg does not break i would go higher for amount of floors higher me / 2 I found f floor when I had to go up or down just 1 floor, and it will be the floor where egg didn't break

Runtime complexity is O(log n)
